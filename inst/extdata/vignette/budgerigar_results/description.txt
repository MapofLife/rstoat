Annotation results for your dataset, Budgerigar Annotator Demo Dataset, uploaded to Map of Life.

### Available files:
- params.json: annotation parameters
- species.csv: dataset records along with an "event_id" for unique spatiotemporal values
- unique_events.csv: unique spatiotemporal records
- modis_lst_day_results.csv: Results for MODIS - Land Surface Temperature Day



### Result columns:
- event_id: A uuid, that will be used to match the annotation back to corresponding records
- product: The product i.e. 'modis'
- variable: The variable i.e. 'lst_day'
- s_buff: The spatial buffer radius in meters
- t_buff: The temporal buffer in days. 
- value: The temporal (arithmetic) mean of the zonal mean (renamed from "mean")
- stdev: The temporal mean of the zonal standard deviation
- pixel_count: The temporal mean of the number of non null pixels per scene
- total_scenes: The total number of scenes in the range
- total_value_scenes: The total number of scenes which have a non-null zonal reduction
- notes: A place for string errors i.e. 'output width or height is less than 1 pixel'


### Notes:
- Temporal buffer (t_buff) applies to individual records and filters scenes prior to the record's event date.
- Spatial buffer (s_buff) uniform weight applied to individual records
